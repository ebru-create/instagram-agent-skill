description: >-
  Write the day's Instagram Stories - the frame-by-frame sequence, which
  stickers to use where, and the one that moves people into the DMs. Use when
  the user says "stories", "what do I post on my story", "story sequence",
  "poll idea", "I have nothing to story about", or wants to sell something
  without making a post about it.

# ig-story

## Content language

Use the language explicitly requested for this content, then the selected
account's voice profile; otherwise follow the supplied text or conversation.
Do not guess from a competitor's handle. For mixed content, ask for the main
language when it matters. Preserve Turkish characters, names, currency and the
brand's tone; do not translate English templates literally.
Pass `--language tr` or `--language en` explicitly to humanize, detect, hookscore,
beats, caption and swipe. The CLI default stays English for compatibility.
For Turkish, use `slop.tr.json` and `hooks.tr.json`; unavailable checks are N/A.
English contractions and explicit pronouns are not requirements for Turkish.
Use approved Turkish brand examples for manual voice review; do not rewrite
just to raise a score. Turkish scores are provisional editorial signals,
not validated performance predictions or AI-authorship detection.

## Account context

For a slot from `ig-plan`, preserve its publishing account, goal, time budget,
post/frame count and camera constraints. These take precedence over this skill's
generic format suggestions. Read the resolved `strategy` brief if needed.

For account-specific work, resolve the user's publishing handle from the request
or established conversation, not a research target or message recipient. Run
`../ig-account/account.py show --account HANDLE` with Python from this skill's
folder (or use the helper's absolute installed path). Without an established
handle, run `show` without `--account`: legacy paths work only when no named
accounts exist; otherwise ask which publishing account to use.
Use only the returned paths, read that account's voice when relevant, and pass
the same handle to downstream skills. Missing files never fall back to another
account. On switching accounts, discard the previous account's context. Include
`account: @HANDLE` in receipts for saved work. Text-only edits need no selection
unless they use saved brand context. If the helper is unavailable, work from
supplied text without saved context or filesystem writes; install the full pack
for persistent profiles. See [account setup](../ig-account/SKILL.md).

Stories are not a smaller feed. The feed is how strangers find you. Stories are
how the people who already follow you decide whether you are a person worth
buying from, and they are the only surface on Instagram where a tap turns into
a conversation in one move.

Use the account’s observed Story audience and current goal. Do not assume
every viewer is a follower or that Stories have one universal job.

## An optional sequence

Choose a frame count and frequency that fit the agreed plan, assets and budget.
One useful frame can be enough; there is no daily minimum. The following longer
sequence is an option when the content warrants it, not a required template.

```
1       THE OPEN     something happening today, with a face or a hand in it.
2-3     THE MIDDLE   the actual content: the process, the result, the mistake.
4       THE ASK      one sticker. Poll, question box, quiz or link.
5       THE CLOSE    the answer, the outcome, or tomorrow's setup.
```

Put the intended action where it makes sense in the chosen sequence. Use the
account’s completion data if available; do not invent an optimal frame number.

## The stickers, and what each is actually for

| sticker | job | use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Poll** | the cheapest tap there is | you want volume of response, not information |
| **Question box** | harvesting the exact words people use | you need content ideas or objections, verbatim |
| **Quiz** | teaching by letting them be wrong | there is a common misconception in the niche |
| **Slider** | vibe check | nothing important. Fun, low value |
| **Link** | the only clickable surface besides the bio | there is somewhere real to go |
| **Countdown** | a deadline people can subscribe to | a launch, a live, a close date |
| **Add yours** | reach beyond your followers, occasionally | the prompt is one anyone in the niche can answer |

The question box is the most undervalued one in the list. Every answer is a
caption, a Reel hook or a DM opener written in the audience's own words. Feed
them to `ig-reel` as formula #16.

## Rules

- **Choose a clear opening that fits the brand and available assets.** A face,
  hand, illustration or text can be appropriate. Respect faceless constraints.
- **One idea per frame.** Reading a paragraph on a story is not a thing anyone
  does.
- **Keep text inside the middle.** On 1080x1920, nothing above y=250 or below
  y=1600. The profile row sits on top and the reply bar sits underneath.
- **Talk to one person.** "You" singular. Stories are the closest thing to a
  DM that is not one.
- **Do not repost your own feed post to stories with no comment.** It is the
  single most ignored frame on the platform. If you are pointing at a post, say
  what happened in the comments and why it is worth going back for.
- **Place an offer where it supports the agreed goal.** Context, offer and
  proof can work as a sequence; do not claim it will outperform feed posts
  without comparable account evidence.

## The DM funnel, done honestly

The sequence that works: a story that names a problem, a question box or a poll
that lets people say "that's me", and then a reply to each person who answered.
The conversation starts because they spoke first.

Automated keyword DM replies are a real, supported feature for professional
accounts, through Instagram's own tools and approved partners. Bulk DMing
people who did not interact is not, and it is what gets accounts restricted.
The rule is simple: **they act first, then you reply.**

## Output

The frames in order, each with what is on screen, what is said, and which
sticker, plus what to do with the answers:

```
STORIES  ·  Tuesday  ·  5 frames

1  [selfie, walking]      "Third refund request this year. Same reason."
2  [screen recording]     the clause, highlighted
3  [talking]              "Approval is a feeling. Delivery is a date."
4  [poll]                 "Have you been burned by a late approval?"  Yes / Not yet
5  [text on photo]        "Reply and I will send you the clause."

After: everyone who votes Yes gets a reply. That is the whole funnel.
```

Nothing is posted. The user posts it.
