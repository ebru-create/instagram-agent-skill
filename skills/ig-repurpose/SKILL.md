description: >-
  Turn one long asset - a YouTube video, podcast, livestream, newsletter, blog
  post or client call - into a week of reels and carousels. Use when the user
  says "repurpose this", "turn this into reels", "I have a video/podcast/
  transcript", "cut this up", or pastes something long and wants it on
  Instagram.

# ig-repurpose

## Content language

Use the language explicitly requested for this content, then the selected
account's voice profile; otherwise follow the supplied text or conversation.
Do not guess from a competitor's handle. For mixed content, ask for the main
language when it matters. Preserve Turkish characters, names, currency and the
brand's tone; do not translate English templates literally.
Pass `--language tr` or `--language en` explicitly to humanize, detect, hookscore,
beats, caption and swipe. The CLI default stays English for compatibility.
For Turkish, use `slop.tr.json` and `hooks.tr.json`; unavailable checks are N/A.
English contractions and explicit pronouns are not requirements for Turkish.
Use approved Turkish brand examples for manual voice review; do not rewrite
just to raise a score. Turkish scores are provisional editorial signals,
not validated performance predictions or AI-authorship detection.

## Account context

For account-specific work, resolve the user's publishing handle from the request
or established conversation, not a research target or message recipient. Run
`../ig-account/account.py show --account HANDLE` with Python from this skill's
folder (or use the helper's absolute installed path). Without an established
handle, run `show` without `--account`: legacy paths work only when no named
accounts exist; otherwise ask which publishing account to use.
Use only the returned paths, read that account's voice when relevant, and pass
the same handle to downstream skills. Missing files never fall back to another
account. On switching accounts, discard the previous account's context. Include
`account: @HANDLE` in receipts for saved work. Text-only edits need no selection
unless they use saved brand context. If the helper is unavailable, work from
supplied text without saved context or filesystem writes; install the full pack
for persistent profiles. See [account setup](../ig-account/SKILL.md).

One good long asset contains four to six posts. Most people extract one and
throw the rest away.

## Input

A transcript, an article, a newsletter, a script, a call summary, a livestream.
If the user gives a URL and this session has a transcript tool, use it;
otherwise ask them to paste. Read the whole thing before extracting anything.

If the source is a video the user owns, ask for the file too. A Reel built on
their own footage beats one built on their own words read again.

## Extract, do not summarise

A summary of a video is not a Reel. Nobody wants the summary. Go through the
asset and pull out the things that stand alone:

| pull | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Claims** | every sentence that would start an argument |
| **Numbers** | every figure, cost, duration, percentage |
| **Stories** | every moment with a person, a scene and a cost |
| **Mechanisms** | every "the way this actually works is..." |
| **Mistakes** | every admission of something that went wrong |
| **Lines** | every sentence already quotable as-is |

List what you found, with counts, before writing anything. If the asset yields
fewer than four items, it is thin, and four posts squeezed out of it will be
thin too. Say that.

## Then pick the format per extract

Not everything is a Reel.

- **Claim, mistake, story** to a Reel. They need a voice and a face.
- **Mechanism, numbered list** to a carousel. They need to be re-read.
- **A quotable line** to a story frame, not a post.

## Then build the week

Each extract becomes one post and each post stands completely on its own. The
viewer has not seen the source and never will. Never write "as I said in my
latest video". The post is the thing.

Assign a hook formula from `ig-reel/hooks.json` to each and vary them. Five
posts from one source with the same hook shape reads as a content mill, because
it is one.

If the source is the user's own video, **use the actual footage**. The clip
where they said the thing, with the real reaction in it, beats a re-record
every time. Cut on the sentence, not on the breath.

Order across the week so the strongest claim goes first, the story lands
midweek, and the mechanism goes last, when the people who liked the earlier
ones are watching for it.

## Output

```
SOURCE: "Why we killed discovery calls" (42 min podcast, 8,900 words)

FOUND  5 claims, 9 numbers, 3 stories, 4 mechanisms, 2 mistakes, 7 quotable lines

WEEK
TUE  REEL      #2  Negative Command  Stop running discovery calls
                                     use the 14:20 clip, he laughs at the end
WED  CAROUSEL  Job B caption         The 4-question form that replaced the call
FRI  REEL      #21 Mid-Sentence      "...and he asked for a refund nine days later"
SUN  REEL      #5  Time Collapse     Six hours a week back, one deleted link

Say "write Tuesday" and I will draft it.
```

Then draft on request, one at a time, each through `/ig-reel` and `/ig-human`.
Do not dump four finished scripts at once. They will all sound the same and the
user will shoot none of them.
